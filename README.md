  <h1 align="center">Version MaNaging package - VMN</h1>
</p>

A simple package for auto increasing version numbers of any application agnostic to language or architecture.

`vmn` is fully compliant with https://semver.org semantics

## Usage

```sh
cd to/your/repository
vmn -h


## Needed only once per repository.
vmn init

## Needed only once per app-name
vmn init-app <app-name>

# will stamp 0.0.1
vmn stamp -r patch <app-name>

# example for starting from version 1.6.8
vmn init-app -v 1.6.8 <app-name2>
# will stamp 1.7.0
vmn stamp -r minor <app-name2>
```

### Release candidates

```sh
cd to/your/repository
vmn init-app -v 1.6.8 <app-name>
# will stamp 2.0.0-alpha1
vmn stamp -r major --pr alpha <app-name>
# will stamp 2.0.0-alpha2
vmn stamp --pr alpha <app-name>
# will stamp 2.0.0-mybeta1
vmn stamp --pr mybeta <app-name>
# Run release when you ready - will stamp 2.0.0
vmn release -v 2.0.0-mybeta1 <app-name>
```
### show

```sh
cd to/your/repository

vmn show <app-name>
vmn show --verbose <app-name>
vmn show -v 1.0.1 <app-name>
```

### goto

```sh
cd to/your/repository
vmn goto -v 1.0.1 <app-name>
```

## Installation

```sh
pip3 install vmn
```

## Why `vmn` is agnostic to application language?
It is the application's reposibility to actualy set the version number at build time. The version
 string can be retreived from
```sh
vmn show <app-name>
```
and be injected via a custom script to the application's code during its build phase.
Actually `vmn` uses this technique for itself.

## Advanced features
### Root apps

`vmn` supports stamping of something called a "root app". For example:

`vmn stamp -r patch my_root_app/service1`

`vmn stamp -r patch my_root_app/service2`

`vmn stamp -r patch my_root_app/service3`

Next we'll be able to use `show` to display everything we need:

`vmn show --verbose my_root_app/service3`

```yml
vmn_info:
  description_message_version: '1'
  vmn_version: <the version of vmn itself that has stamped the application>
stamping:
  msg: 'my_root_app/service3: update to version 0.0.1'
  app:
    name: my_root_app/service3
    _version: 0.0.1
    release_mode: patch
    prerelease: release
    previous_version: 0.0.0
    stamped_on_branch: master
    changesets:
      .:
        hash: 8bbeb8a4d3ba8499423665ba94687b551309ea64
        remote: <remote url>
        vcs_type: git
    info: {}
  root_app:
    name: my_root_app
    version: 3
    latest_service: my_root_app/service3
    services:
      my_root_app/service1: 0.0.1
      my_root_app/service2: 0.0.1
      my_root_app/service3: 0.0.1
    external_services: {}
```

`vmn show my_root_app/service3` will output `0.0.1`
`vmn show --root my_root_app` will output `3`

### Configuration
vmn auto generates a `conf.yml` file that can be modified later by the user. An example of `conf.yml` file:
```yml
# Autogenerated by vmn. You can edit this configuration file
conf:
  template: '[{major}][.{minor}]'
  deps:
    ../:
      <repo dir name>:
        remote: <remote url>
        vcs_type: git
  extra_info: false
```

#### Configuration: template
The template configuration string can be customized and will be applied on the "raw" vmn version.
`vmn` will display the version based on the `template`. In this case the output version will be `0.0`.

For example:
`vmn show my_root_app/service3` will output `0.0`
however running:
`vmn show --raw my_root_app/service3` will output `0.0.1`

#### Configuration: deps
In `deps` you can specify other repositories as your dependencies and `vmn` will consider them when stamping and performing `goto`.

#### Configuration: extra_info
Setting this to `true` will make `vmn` output lots of usefull data about the host on which `vmn` has stamped the version.
This feature is not very popular and may be remove / altered in the future

This project is just a small side project that I've started, decided to share it. We'll see if it will ramp up.

We will thank you for every contribution :)
